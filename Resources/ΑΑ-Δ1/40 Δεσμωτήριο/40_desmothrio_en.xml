        	It is a building of rectangular plan with a central entrance leading to a corridor. Small rooms, the cells, open up to the right and left of the corridor and stop on the south side where a large courtyard opens up. In an adjacent cistern many medicinal vials were found, perhaps used for the hemlock given to those condemned to death. A statuette of Socrates, who was killed here with hemlock in 399 BC, was also found in the ruins of the building. The building dates back to the 5th century BC.
