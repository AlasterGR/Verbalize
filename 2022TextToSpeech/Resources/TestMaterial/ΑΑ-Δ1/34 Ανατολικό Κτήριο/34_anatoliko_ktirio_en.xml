        	A transverse wall inside divided it into two parts: in the eastern part there was an elongated hall with a floor of small pieces of marble. On this peculiar mosaic floor were placed large marble slabs with notches (only four of the original twelve survive today), suitable for holding wooden furniture, probably small tables.  In the western part of the building there were four halls and a staircase leading to the lower level of the South Square. The spacious courtyard opening on the east side, capable of accommodating large crowds of people, reinforces the building's use as a financial institution. During the period when Athens and its Agora were an intellectual centre, to which young students flocked from the far reaches of the Hellenistic world, many coins of varying value were in circulation. In order to facilitate commercial transactions some persons, the silversmiths, were charged with knowing the value and weight of the coins of each city-state and kingdom, so as to determine their exchange value in relation to the Athenian. In addition, they had to check the authenticity of the coins (whether they were fiat or underweight) and to provide the possibility of deposits or the granting of interest-bearing loans.
When the second South Stoa was later built, the East Building took on the role of connecting them while ensuring access to the Panathenaic Road.  The East Building was extensively damaged during Sulla's raid. It was rebuilt in the 2nd century AD, along with other parts of the South Square, until it was completely destroyed by the Heruli in the 3rd century AD.
